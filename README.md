# Card34
A compact split keyboard with 34 keys and bluetooth connection

Initial design is done starting from Sweep2.1 half design.

wiring is kept same as the sweep so Sweep compatible firmware should be also compatible with the Card34.

Card34 is supposed to work only through Bluetooth so TRRS connection has not been included.
